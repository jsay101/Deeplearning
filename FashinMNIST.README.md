Deeplearning
The code provided is a basic implementation of a neural network model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is defined as a linear model with two hidden layers. The train, validation, and test datasets are loaded, and a random subset of the train dataset is selected for training and validation purposes. The test dataset is used for final evaluation.

The train_model function trains the model for a specified number of epochs using the Adam optimizer and the cross-entropy loss function. The function returns the loss and accuracy for both the training and validation datasets at each epoch.

Overall, the code provides a good starting point for implementing a neural network model for image classification.
